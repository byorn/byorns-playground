                    I embarked on my journey with computers back in 1985, diving into the world of technology on an 8086 IBM XT. It was here that I cut my teeth on programming, starting with languages like Basic and DBASE 3+. Yes, it's fair to say I've been around the block a few times!

                    Transitioning to the professional realm, my career as a Software Engineer officially began in 2002. My inaugural project involved crafting an HRM and Payroll system using VB6, marking the start of my voyage into the realms of Java 1.2.

                    Fast forward to the present, my focus has shifted towards a dynamic blend of programming languages. Javascript/Typescript, Java, and React have become my mainstays, complemented by a myriad of technology stacks.

                    Currently, I'm engaged in upskilling endeavors, venturing into the realms of GOLANG and RUST to broaden my expertise.

                    Over the years, I've honed my craft, crafting an array of front-end components using React and Typescript, while also architecting robust API endpoints across diverse business domains. My toolkit spans Java/Spring and Node/Express, allowing me to tackle challenges with versatility and finesse.

                    Beyond development, I've delved into the realm of automation, orchestrating DevOps pipelines with Jenkins, Bamboo, and exploring emerging tools like Terraform and AWS CDK. My journey with AWS services and K8s clusters has provided invaluable insights, augmented by hands-on experience with HELM charts and Docker containers.

                    Throughout my career, I've navigated the landscape as both an individual contributor and a leader, steering projects to success and nurturing smaller teams through mentorship and guidance.
