                    I started with computers in 1985 on an 8086 IBM XT.  &nbsp;&nbsp; My first programming languages were Basic, and DBASE 3+.  <br/> <br/>
                    Yes I am  old ! :D
                    <br/><br/>
                    Actually, my first job as a Software Engineer was in 2002, when I built an HRM and Payroll system in VB6, before I moved into Java 1.2
                    <br/><br/>
                    Now my main programming languages are Javascript/Typescript, Java and React, and all the technology stacks that come around it.
                    <br/><br/>
                    I am currently upskilling to GOLANG and RUST.
                    <br/><br/>
                    I have built various front-end components with React and Typescript and have built various API end points
                    for various business domains, mainly on Java/Spring and a bit of Node/Express.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Have got my hands on a bit on automating dev ops pipelines with Jenkins and Bamboo.
                    Currently experimenting on Terraform, and AWS CDK tools.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Have experience with various AWS services and K8s clusters and have exposure working with HELM charts and docker containers.
                    <br/><br/>
                    For the most of my career I&apos;ve always remained an individual contributor but I have experience leading projects and guiding and mentoring smaller teams.
